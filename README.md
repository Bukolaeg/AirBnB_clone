#Project Description
This project involves the development of a simplified Airbnb clone, covering essential concepts in the higher-level programming track. The project includes a command interpreter, static and dynamic web pages, database storage, and a RESTful API.

Command Interpreter
How to Start
Open a terminal.
Navigate to the project directory.
bash
Copy code
cd /path/to/airbnb_clone_project
Run the command interpreter.
bash
Copy code
python3 console.py
How to Use
The command interpreter allows you to manipulate objects, create and update data, and interact with the storage system. Refer to the command interpreter documentation for detailed usage instructions.

Examples
Create a new object:
python
Copy code
create User
Update an object:
python
Copy code
update User 1234-5678 {"name": "John"}
Retrieve objects:
python
Copy code
all User
Web Static
HTML/CSS
Learn HTML and CSS to create static web pages. Define the HTML structure for your application and design templates for each object.

MySQL Storage
Replace file storage with MySQL database storage. Utilize an ORM to map models to corresponding database tables.

Web Framework - Templating
Create a web server using a Python framework. Make static HTML files dynamic by integrating objects from files or databases.

RESTful API
Expose objects via a JSON web interface. Manipulate objects via a RESTful API, providing endpoints for CRUD operations.

Web Dynamic
Learn jQuery for dynamic web interactions. Load objects dynamically from the client side using your RESTful API.

Files and Directories
models: Contains classes representing data models.
tests: Holds unit tests for the project.
console.py: Entry point for the command interpreter.
models/base_model.py: Base class for all models with common elements and methods.
models/engine: Storage classes directory.
Storage
Persist data using file storage initially. Convert objects to JSON format for serialization and deserialization.

Python Packages
Proper organization of files into packages enhances modularity. Use package structures for better code management.
